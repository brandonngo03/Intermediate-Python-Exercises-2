# Intermediate-Python-Exercises-2
Complete the following 3 Python exercises. Create each exercise in a separate folder and push all the folders to GitHub as a single repository. Each script is worth 1 point, successfully creating your virtual environment and requirements.txt in the last exercise is worth 1 point (do NOT commit the virtual environment), and making your git commits and private repository is worth 1 point. You may form groups of up to 5; leave your group members' names as a comment at the top of each file so we don't flag you for cheating.

As always, you are encouraged to use any resource available to you, whether that be me, the TAs, the CCI tutoring center, Google or ChatGPT. If you use any of these resources, please leave a comment in your code indicating what the resource is and a link if you found help online. If you copy code from online, please leave a detailed comment explaining what the code does. If we suspect you copied code that you do not understand, we may quiz you and deduct points if you cannot explain your script.
